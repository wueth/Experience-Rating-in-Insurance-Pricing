# Experience-Rating-in-Insurance-Pricing
This respository contains the R code to the lecture notes "Experience Rating in Insurance Pricing".
The lecture notes can be downloaded from https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4726206
The file DataSynthetic.rda contains the data used in these lecture notes, and this data is described in more detail in Appendix A of the lectures notes.
We will also make the code available to replicate the examples in the lecture notes, but this requires still a bit more work.
